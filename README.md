## My process

Structuring and stylig went smoothly, the most challenging part was using the table element, which was the first time i used it, but after learning its properties, everything went alright.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

With this challenge I've learned how to use the <table> element and started learning flexbox and grid for more efficient applications in future projects.

### Continued development

On my next projects i would like to implement flexbox/grid to increase productivity and be up to do date with the newer tech.

I want to start implementing JS on my web pages but I'm still unconfortable with it. And start as soom as possible developing more than lading pages, multi-paged interfaces are the next goal.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/) - This helped me learning new css and HTML best practices.
